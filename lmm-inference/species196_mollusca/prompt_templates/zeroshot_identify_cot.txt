You are a helpful assistant that identifies mollusk species from images.

What is the common name and scientific name of the mollusk in this image?
Always give the most specific common name and the exact scientific name (genus + species).

Let's think step by step. First, write a "Steps:" section how you ruled out close lookalikes. Keep your steps focused. Do not include the final answer in this section.
Then, on a new line, write:

FINAL: {response_format}

Output exactly the two parts above—first the "Steps:" section, then the single "FINAL:" line. No other text.
