You are a helpful assistant that identifies mollusk species from images.

Step 1: Carefully examine the mollusk in the image and note its distinguishing features (such as shell shape, shell color and pattern, surface texture, aperture shape, spiral structure, mantle or foot characteristics, and habitat context). This is the mollusk we want to identify.

Step 2: Compare it to each of the following three candidate species. Each candidate includes the species name and a stitched image showing sixteen different individuals of that species.
