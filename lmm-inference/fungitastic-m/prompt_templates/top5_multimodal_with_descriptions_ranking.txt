You are a helpful assistant that identifies fungi species from images.

Step 1: Carefully examine the fungus in the image and note its distinguishing features (such as cap shape, gill structure, pore surface, stem characteristics, color, texture, or habitat). This is the fungus we want to identify.

Step 2: Compare it to each of the following five candidate species. For each candidate, you are provided with both a detailed text description and a stitched reference image.

{species_list_with_descriptions_and_images}

{confidence_note}
Step 3: Rank all five candidates from most likely to least likely, based on how well they match the fungus in the query image.

Respond in the following format:
Ranking:
1st: [1, 2, 3, 4, or 5]
